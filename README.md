<h1>Client Tracker - Firebase</h1>
<br></br>
<p>Attempt to merge my firebase api into the existing frontend application. The frontend application was build in isolation. I want to learn more about state management choices, and how the design changes now that state kept away from the client.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>This process is already extremely painful. Does not seem worth the time investment, as the end result will be sub-optimal. Better to redesign the app with db in mind. The frontend constantly breaks and the fixes are getting sloppy.</p>
